      <p id ="indent">My name is Pablo Dueñas, I am 21 years old, and I was born and raised in Los Angeles, California. I am an undergraduate student at California State 
          Polytechnic University, Pomona majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Data Science. I am first-generation Mexican-American, 
          first-generation college student, and a proud Angeleno. Growing up, I had always been fascinated by the evolution of technology and 
          software. My first exposure to technology was in 2005 when my parents gifted me a Gameboy Advanced for Christmas. I was in awe as to 
          how something so small could bring me such enjoyment. Flash forward to today, my dream is to become a software engineer and help improve 
          the lives of many people through the power of code.</p>
      <p id ="indent">As a child of immigrants from México, I carry a perspective that isn't very represented in the world of technology. 
          I am able to empathize with the struggles many Latinos face while navigating the differences between their households and life in the United 
          States. In the future, I would like to contribute back and create resources that will help Latinos and other marginalized groups improve their 
          quality of life.</p>
